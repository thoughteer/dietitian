# Dietitian

A simple diet optimizer

### Usage

Fill up a tab-separated menu file providing a name, proteins, fats, carbohydrates,
and a score for each item, e.g.
```
Chicken breast	60	5	2	-250.0
Milk (100 ml)	3	4	5	-100.0
...
```

Then you can aim for a specific set of nutrition ranges while maximizing the overall score.
